                <p>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of Ancient
                    Greek
                    folklore. These stories concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of
                    deities,
                    <a href="GREEK/godsGreek.html">gods</a>, and mythological creatures.

                <p>At the Nordic mythology the world is represented like a flat disk. The disk is situated at the
                    branches
                    of the tree in the world Yggdrasil, that sustained the nine worlds. At him inhabited several
                    creatures.
                    Asgard, the tall region of the sky, where lived the <a href="NORDIC/godsNordic.html">gods</a>, was
                    localised at the centre of the disk, and
                    only could arrive until there walking for the rainbow (the bridge Bifr√∂st), saved by Heimdall, who
                    was
                    catered of a big horn with which warned every time that a god of the pantheon or a Vanir crossed it.
