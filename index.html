            <p>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of Ancient Greek
                folklore. These stories concern the origin and nature of the world, the lives and activities of deities,

            <p>At the Nordic mythology the world is represented like a flat disk. The disk is situated at the branches
                of the tree in the world Yggdrasil, that sustained the nine worlds. At him inhabited several creatures.
                Asgard, the tall region of the sky, where lived the <a href="NORDIC/godsNordic.html">gods</a>, was
                localised at the centre of the disk, and
                only could arrive until there walking for the rainbow (the bridge Bifr√∂st), saved by Heimdall, who was
                catered of a big horn with which warned every time that a god of the pantheon or a Vanir crossed it.</p>
