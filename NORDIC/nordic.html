                <p>Norse mythology is full of fascinating stories and complex characters. It’s no wonder that it has
                    seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, from Marvel’s <a
                        href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(pel%C3%ADcula)">Thor</a> movies to <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gods"> Neil Gaiman’s
                        American
                        Gods</a>(the book and the TV series) to Rick Riordan’s Magnus Chase series.</p>

                <p>The story of Gylfaginning begins with King Gylfi of Sweden travelling to <i>Ásgarðr</i> (Asgard)
                    disguised
                    as an old man named “Gangleri” to ask the Æsir questions about the universe.

                <p>He meets Óðinn (Odin), who is also disguised and presents himself as as three kings named “Hárr”
                    (High), “Jafnhárr” (Just-as-High) and “Þriði” (Third). Gylfi asks permission to ask his questions
                    and Odin replies:</p>
                <p>“Stand forward while you inquire;</p>
                <p>The one who recounts shall sit.”</p>
                <p> While we won’t insist that you stand while reading this blog post, we will hopefully answer any
                    questions that you may have about Norse mythology.</p>

                <h3>The nine worlds of Norse mythology</h3>
                <p>The Norse universe consists of nine worlds. These worlds are only referenced a few times throughout
                    the myths and are not specified, but are thought to be (in no particular order) <a
                        href="https://skjalden.com/nine-realms-in-norse-mythology/">Asgard, Vanaheimr (Vanaheim),
                        Jötunheimr (Jotunheim), Niflheim, Muspelheim, Álfheimr (Alfheim), Svartálfaheimr
                        (Svartalfheim), Niðavellir (Nidavellir), and Miðgarðr (Midgard) </a>
                    which is our world.</p>

                <p>These worlds are connected by a great ash tree named <i>Yggdrasil</i>, which runs through the centre of the
                    universe. An eagle lives at the top of <i>Yggdrasil</i>, while the dragon Niðhöggr (Nidhogg) lives at the
                    bottom and chews on its roots. The squirrel Ratatosk runs up and down <i>Yggdrasil's</i> trunk, carrying
                    messages between these two creatures – and they’re not particularly nice messages either.</p>

                <p>In addition to holding everything together, <i>Yggdrasil</i> is also a source of wisdom and is where the
                    Æsir often gather for meetings. At the foot of the tree is <i>Urðarbrunnr</i> (Urd’s well), which is
                    associated with the three Norns or “fates”.</p>

                <p>Under another root is Mímisbrunnr (Mímir’s well), which is where Odin gave up his eye as payment for
                    a drink in order to gain the well’s knowledge. It is also thought that <i>Yggdrasil</i> is the tree that
                    Odin hung himself on, again in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
