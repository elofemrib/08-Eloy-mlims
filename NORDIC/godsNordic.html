                <h2>GODS NORDIC</h2>

                <h3>Odin</h3>
                <p>The Norse gods were separated into two main groups, the <i>Æsir</i> and the Vanir, who at one point in their
                    histories engaged in a fierce and bitter war. Odin was the King of the <i>Æsir</i> clan and known as 'the
                    father of all gods'. He was often depicted as a one-eyed, bearded old man wearing a hat and a cloak,
                    who rode a flying eight-legged horse called Sleipnir.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Odín.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Frigg</h3>
                <p>As the wife of Odin, Frigg was regarded as the Queen of the <i>Æsir</i> gods and therefore possibly the most
                    important of all the Norse goddesses. She was the only one allowed to sit next to her husband and
                    although he conducted many extra-marital affairs, she always stuck by her partner.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Frigg.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Thor</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the Marvel Universe, Thor is one of the most famous and recognisable Norse gods in today’s
                    world. He was the god of thunder and lightning who wielded the Mjölnir, a devastatingly powerful
                    hammer that could slay giants and smash mountains. He rode a chariot drawn by two massive goats
                    called Tanngniost and Tanngrisnir.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Thor.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Loki</h3>
                <p>Another god made famous in modern times thanks to his inclusion in the Marvel movies, although in
                    Norse mythology he wasn’t the son of Odin and brother of Thor as the films have made out. Instead,
                    he was considered a ‘blood brother’ of Odin who lived amongst the <i>Æsir</i>.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Loki.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Freya</h3>
                <p>Freya was the goddess of fate, love, beauty, gold, war and fertility. She was a member of the Vanir
                    and ruled over the heavenly meadow of Fólkvangr, where half of all those who died in combat would
                    go, whilst the other half were guided by the Valkyries to Valhalla which was ruled over by Odin.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Freya.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Blader</h3>
                <p>Another son of Odin and half-brother to Thor, Balder was the god of light and purity. He was
                    described as a fair, kind and handsome god, whose beauty was unparalleled. Often praised by others
                    for his mercifulness, Balder was the epitome of all things wise and good.</p>
                <img src="../IMAGES/Blader.jpg" class="godsnordic">

                <h3>Hel</h3>
                <p>The daughter of Loki, Hel presided over the Norse underworld, a place where all those Vikings who
                    didn’t die in battle went. <br>

                    Half of her body was flesh and blood, the other half was just bones. Her decaying features befitted
                    a goddess who ruled over the land of the dead, judging and deciding the fate of the souls who
                    entered her realm. It was said that within the underworld she was more powerful than Odin himself, a
                    belief that was reinforced when she held the final say on what happened to Balder’s soul after he
                    was slain.</p>
