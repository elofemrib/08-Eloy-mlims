                <p>There is no single original text, like the Christian Bible or the Hindu Vedas, that introduces all
                    Greek
                    myths’ characters and stories. Instead, the earliest Greek myths were part of an oral tradition that
                    began
                    in the Bronze Age, and their plots and themes unfolded gradually in the written literature of the
                    archaic
                    and classical periods of the ancient Mediterranean world.</p>
                <p>The poet Homer’s 8th-century BC epics, <i>The Iliad and The Odyssey</i>, for example, tell the story
                    of the
                    Trojan
                    War as a divine conflict as well as a human one. They do not, however, bother to introduce the gods
                    and
                    goddesses who are their main characters, since readers and listeners would already have been
                    familiar with
                    them.</p>

                <p>Around 700 BC, the poet Hesiod’s <i>Theogony</i> offered the first written cosmogony, or origin
                    story, of Greek
                    mythology. The Theogony tells the story of the universe’s journey from nothingness (Chaos, a
                    primeval void)
                    into being, and details an elaborate family tree of elements, gods and goddesses who evolved from
                    Chaos and
                    descended from Gaia (Earth), Ouranos (Sky), Pontos (Sea) and Tartaros (the Underworld).</p>

                <p>Later Greek writers and artists used and elaborated upon these sources in their own work. For
                    instance,
                    mythological figures and events appear in the 5th-century plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and
                    Euripides and
                    the lyric poems of Pindar. Writers such as the 2nd-century BC Greek mythographer Apollodorus of
                    Athens and
                    the 1st-century BC Roman historian Gaius Julius Hyginus compiled the ancient myths and legends for
                    contemporary audiences.</p>

                <p>At the center of Greek mythology is the pantheon of gods and goddesses who were said to live on Mount
                    Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. From their lofty perch, they ruled every aspect of human
                    life. Olympian deities looked like men and women (though they could change themselves into animals
                    and other things) and were vulnerable to human foibles and passions.
